## ZenML MLOps Starter - Progress Summary

### What We've Achieved So Far

- **Project Setup**  
  Initialized a Poetry-managed Python project named `zenml-mlops-starter` targeting Python 3.9 to 3.10.

- **Modular Pipelines**  
  Created two modular pipeline packages:  
  - `classification_pipeline` — includes core components like data loading, training, and evaluation steps.  
  - `regression_pipeline` — scaffolded with package structure, ready for custom regression steps.

- **Integrated Key Dependencies**  
  Added essential ML and MLOps libraries:  
  - [ZenML](https://zenml.io/) for orchestrating and deploying ML pipelines  
  - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) for modeling  
  - [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for data processing  
  - [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) for experiment tracking  
  - [Optuna](https://optuna.org/) for hyperparameter tuning

- **Poetry Packaging**  
  Configured `pyproject.toml` to explicitly include both pipelines for clean packaging and future distribution.

- **Virtual Environment & Installation**  
  Resolved Python version compatibility issues and successfully installed dependencies and the project into a Poetry virtual environment.

- **Project Structure Verification**  
  Confirmed the package structure and successful imports within the Poetry environment to ensure readiness for development.

### What This Enables

- A solid **foundation** to build, run, and deploy classification and regression ML pipelines using ZenML.  
- Seamless integration with experiment tracking (MLflow) and hyperparameter optimization (Optuna).  
- Modular and maintainable code structure for scaling and adding new workflows.  
- Ready for pipeline orchestration and deployment locally or on the cloud.

---

### Next Steps

- Develop training and inference scripts for the classification pipeline.  
- Expand the regression pipeline with custom steps.  
- Add unit and integration tests for pipeline components.  
- Define ZenML pipeline runs and deployment workflows.  
- Enhance documentation and onboarding materials.

- If in the future your project grows in complexity or requires broader workflow management beyond ML tasks, you can integrate Airflow or other orchestrators with ZenML or replace parts of your stack accordingly.
