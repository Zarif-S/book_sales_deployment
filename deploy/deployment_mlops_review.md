# MLOps Pipeline Analysis & Solution Request

## Context: Current MLOps Infrastructure

I have a book sales forecasting pipeline with the following architecture:

### Current Setup
- **Pipeline Framework**: ZenML for orchestration and artifact tracking
- **ML Training**: SARIMA models with Optuna optimization
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow for model versioning and metrics
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Google Cloud Platform (Vertex AI, GCS, Cloud Run)
- **Local Development**: Python environment with ZenML/MLflow installed

### Infrastructure Components

**Local Environment:**
- ZenML installed locally (`use poetry to install`)
- MLflow servers running on ports and 5001
- Local development stack available

** Production Environment:**
- ZenML local:
- MLflow Server: `https://mlflow-tracking-server-1076639696283.europe-west2.run.app`
- Vertex AI Pipelines for scalable execution
- GCS bucket: `gs://book-sales-deployment-artifacts`
- Container Registry: `europe-west2-docker.pkg.dev/upheld-apricot-468313-e0/zenml-book-sales-artifacts`

**Pipeline Stack Configuration:**
```bash
# Production stack
zenml stack set vertex_stack  # Uses remote ZenML + Vertex AI + GCS

# Local stack (if configured)
zenml stack set default       # Uses local orchestrator
```

## Current Problems

### 1. Authentication Issues
- **Remote ZenML server authentication expires** frequently (7-day tokens)
- **Manual re-authentication required** each time I want to run pipelines
- **Authentication failures** prevent pipeline execution
- Error: `CredentialsNotValid: Authentication error: error decoding access token`

### 2. Pipeline Run History Loss
- **ZenML server resets** cause loss of historical run data
- **Stack component IDs change** when server resets, orphaning previous runs
- **No persistence** of experiment history across server resets
- **Repeated setup** of stack components after authentication issues

### 3. Development Workflow Friction
- **Cannot run pipelines reliably** due to authentication failures
- **Lost productivity** from repeated authentication and setup
- **Inconsistent development experience**

## Current Pipeline Architecture

The pipeline (`pipelines/zenml_pipeline.py`) includes:
- Data loading from GCS (`load_isbn_data_step`, `load_uk_weekly_data_step`)
- Data preprocessing and merging
- SARIMA model training with Optuna optimization
- MLflow tracking for experiments and model registry
- Vertex AI orchestration for cloud execution

Key configuration:
```python
# MLflow tracking URI configuration
mlflow_tracking_uri = "https://mlflow-tracking-server-1076639696283.europe-west2.run.app"
mlflow.set_tracking_uri(mlflow_tracking_uri)
```

## Request for Analysis

Please analyze this setup and provide:

### 1. Root Cause Analysis
- Why do ZenML authentication issues keep occurring?
- What causes the pipeline run history loss?
- Are there architectural decisions contributing to these problems?

### 2. Solution Options
- **Multiple approaches** to solve authentication and history persistence issues
- **Trade-offs** between different solutions (complexity, maintenance, reliability)
- **Best practices** for MLOps development vs production environments

### 3. Implementation Recommendations
- **Specific steps** to implement the recommended solution
- **Configuration changes** needed in the pipeline code
- **Infrastructure modifications** required
- **Migration strategy** if switching architectures

## Potential Solution (For Reference)

One approach being considered is a **hybrid local/remote setup**:

**Local Development Environment:**
- Local ZenML server (no authentication issues)
- Local MLflow server (persistent history)
- Local artifact store for fast iteration

**Remote Production Environment:**
- Keep existing remote infrastructure
- Use for production deployments only
- Environment-based configuration switching

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No authentication expiry in development
- ✅ Persistent local run history
- ✅ Fast local development cycles
- ✅ Keep existing production infrastructure
- ✅ Minimal pipeline code changes

**Implementation:**
```python
# Environment-based MLflow URI configuration
if stack_name == "local_stack":
    mlflow_uri = "http://localhost:5001"
elif stack_name == "vertex_stack":
    mlflow_uri = "https://mlflow-tracking-server-xxx.run.app"
```

## Expected Output

Please provide:

1. **Analysis** of the current architecture and root causes
2. **Multiple solution options** with pros/cons
3. **Recommended approach** with justification
4. **Implementation plan** with specific steps
5. **Alternative considerations** if any assumptions are incorrect

## Additional Context

- I prefer solutions that maintain the existing production infrastructure
- Local development speed and reliability are high priorities
- The pipeline processes 2-50 books with SARIMA modeling
- Team size is small (1-2 developers)
- Cloud costs should be minimized for development work
