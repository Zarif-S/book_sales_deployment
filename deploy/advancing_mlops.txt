What Can You Do Next? Advancing Your MLOps Project
Once you have a successful cloud run, you've built a solid foundation. Here are some excellent areas to explore next to make your project more robust and automated.

1. Improve Your Pipeline

Data Validation: Add a step using a library like Great Expectations or Deepchecks right after loading your data. This ensures your data quality is consistent and prevents bad data from breaking your pipeline.

Custom Model Deployer: Your current pipeline trains a model, but it doesn't automatically deploy it. You can write a custom deployment step that, if the model performance is good, automatically registers it to a model registry like Vertex AI Model Registry.

Add Monitoring and Alerting: Create a post-deployment step that monitors the deployed model's predictions for data drift or performance degradation over time, sending alerts if issues are detected.

2. Automate the Process (CI/CD)

Instead of manually running the pipeline from your terminal, you can automate it.

Set up GitHub Actions: Create a workflow that automatically triggers your ZenML pipeline on a schedule (e.g., every Monday to retrain on new weekly data) or whenever new code is merged into your main branch.

3. Enhance the Infrastructure

Deploy a Remote ZenML Server: To solve the warning you saw earlier and get a fully-featured tracking experience, you can deploy the ZenML server on GCP. This gives you a central, collaborative platform for your team to view all pipelines, models, and artifacts.

The Plan: From Model to Prediction Website
1. Deploy Your Trained Model to an Endpoint

First, you need to take the model file that your ZenML pipeline creates (the arima_model_...pkl file) and host it somewhere that can serve predictions. The best place for this in your current setup is Vertex AI Endpoints.

What it is: A fully managed service that takes your model file, hosts it on a server, and gives you a URL (an endpoint) that you can send data to for predictions.

How it works: You'd add a step to the end of your ZenML pipeline that, if the model is good, automatically uploads and deploys it to a Vertex AI Endpoint.

2. Build a Web API (The Middleman)

Next, you need an API to act as the go-between for your website and your deployed model. This is where you'd use a simple Python web framework.

Recommended Tool: FastAPI is modern, fast, and very popular for ML APIs.

What it does:

Receives a request from your website (e.g., a future week and a book ISBN).

Processes that input into the format your model expects.

Calls the Vertex AI Endpoint URL with this data.

Gets the prediction back from Vertex AI.

Sends the prediction back to your website to be displayed.

3. Create the Frontend (The Website)

This is the part the recruiter sees. It would have a date picker and a way to select a book.

Recommended Tool for Quick Prototyping: Streamlit is a Python framework that lets you build data apps and websites very quickly without needing to know HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

How it works: You'd write a simple Streamlit script that creates the UI elements. When the recruiter clicks "Predict," the Streamlit app makes a request to your FastAPI backend.

4. Containerize with Docker üê≥

To deploy your FastAPI and Streamlit apps reliably, you'll package them into Docker containers.

What it is: Docker creates a self-contained package that includes your code and all its dependencies. This ensures your app runs the same way everywhere.

How it works: You'll write a Dockerfile for your web application that installs Python, FastAPI, Streamlit, and copies your code into it.

5. Deploy the Web Application

Finally, you deploy your Docker container to a hosting service. The easiest and most scalable option on Google Cloud is Cloud Run.

What it is: A serverless platform that runs Docker containers. It automatically scales up or down (even to zero, so you don't pay when no one is using it).

How it works: You'd build your Docker image and push it to Google's Artifact Registry, then create a Cloud Run service to run that image. Cloud Run gives you a public URL for your website.

How It All Connects
Here is a diagram showing how your existing ZenML pipeline feeds into this new prediction service.

The Workflow:

Training (What you've built): Your ZenML Pipeline runs on a schedule, trains new models on the latest data, and saves the best model to a model registry.

Serving (The new part):

A recruiter visits your Streamlit Website hosted on Cloud Run.

The website calls your FastAPI (also on Cloud Run).

The API calls the Vertex AI Endpoint.

The Endpoint uses your deployed model to make a prediction and returns it.

The result is displayed on the website.
