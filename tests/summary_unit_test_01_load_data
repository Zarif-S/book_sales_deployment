Key Features of These Advanced Tests:
1. Integration Tests for get_merged_data

Complete flow testing: Tests the entire data pipeline from config to final output
Dependency isolation: All external calls (config, loading, saving) are mocked
Error propagation: Tests how failures in one component affect the whole pipeline
Edge cases: Empty DataFrames, missing data scenarios
Contract verification: Ensures correct parameters are passed between functions

2. Performance Tests

Scalable test data: Uses parametrized fixtures to test different dataset sizes
Realistic thresholds: Performance expectations based on dataset size
Memory efficiency: Tests ensure operations don't consume excessive memory
Scaling analysis: Tests how performance degrades with more data/sheets
Bottleneck identification: Helps identify which operations are slowest

3. External Dependency Mocking

Network isolation: No real HTTP calls during testing
Caching logic: Tests the file freshness and cache fallback logic
Error scenarios: Network failures, file corruption, permission issues
State verification: Ensures correct sequence of external calls
Fallback behavior: Tests graceful degradation when external services fail
