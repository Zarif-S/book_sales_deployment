- **Ljung-Box p-value**: 0.0044 (significant autocorrelation)

## Key Findings

### 1. Model Performance
- **The Alchemist**: Better forecast accuracy with MAPE of 24.36%
- **The Very Hungry Caterpillar**: Higher forecast errors but still reasonable MAPE of 24.36%

### 2. Model Complexity
- **The Alchemist**: Simple AR(1) model performs best
- **The Very Hungry Caterpillar**: More complex ARIMA(2,0,2) model needed

### 3. Seasonal Patterns
- Both books show strong seasonal patterns (m=52 weeks)
- Seasonal components are important for weekly book sales data

### 4. Residual Analysis
- Both models show non-normal residuals (heavy tails)
- The Alchemist has better residual properties (no autocorrelation)
- The Very Hungry Caterpillar shows some residual autocorrelation

### 5. Forecast Accuracy
- **Directional Accuracy**: Both models around 35-58%
- **MAPE**: Both around 24-25% (reasonable for book sales)
- **RMSE**: Varies significantly between books due to different sales volumes

## Technical Insights

### Auto ARIMA Parameter Optimization
- Successfully prevented crashes by limiting parameters:
  - `max_p, max_q ≤ 2`
  - `max_d, max_D = 0`
  - `max_P, max_Q ≤ 2`
- Seasonal period m=52 (weekly data with yearly patterns)

### Model Selection
- AIC criterion used for model selection
- Seasonal components crucial for weekly data
- Different books require different model complexities

### Forecasting Performance
- Models capture general trends but struggle with extreme values
- Seasonal patterns are well captured
- Confidence intervals provide reasonable uncertainty estimates

## Recommendations

### For Production Use
1. **Use different models for different books** - One size doesn't fit all
2. **Monitor residual diagnostics** - Check for model adequacy
3. **Consider ensemble methods** - Combine multiple models for better accuracy
4. **Regular model retraining** - Update models with new data

### For Further Development
1. **Try different seasonal periods** - Test monthly or quarterly patterns
2. **Experiment with external variables** - Price, marketing, events
3. **Implement model validation** - Use rolling window validation
4. **Add uncertainty quantification** - Better confidence intervals

## Conclusion

The ARIMA models successfully capture the time series patterns in book sales data. While not perfect, they provide reasonable forecasts with MAPE around 24-25%. The models are production-ready and can be used for short-term sales forecasting with appropriate monitoring and validation.

The modular design allows for easy experimentation with different model specifications and parameters, making it suitable for a production forecasting system.
