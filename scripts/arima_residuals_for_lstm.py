ARIMA Residuals Analysis for LSTM - Wrapper Module

This module provides convenient access to LSTM-specific residual analysis functions
that are now part of the comprehensive ARIMA model diagnostics.

All functionality has been consolidated into scripts.arima_model_diagnostics for better organization.
