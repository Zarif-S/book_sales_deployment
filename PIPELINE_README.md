# ZenML SARIMA Pipeline Architecture

A production-ready ML pipeline implementing train-serve split architecture for book sales forecasting using SARIMA models with ZenML orchestration and MLflow experiment tracking.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This pipeline implements a separation of concerns between model training and inference, following enterprise ML patterns:

## ✅ Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Training pipeline**: Model development, validation, persistence
- **Inference script**: On-demand predictions from trained artifacts
- **Production architecture**: Exactly how enterprise ML systems are built

### 2. Model Artifact Management
- **MLflow integration**: Model versioning and metadata storage
- **Fallback serialization**: MLflow → pickle for compatibility
- **Vertex AI storage**: Centralized artifact management through ZenML

### 3. Hyperparameter Optimization
- **Optuna integration**: Early stopping and intelligent search
- **Parameter seeding**: Book-specific optimization starting points
- **Environment awareness**: Development vs production configurations

### 4. Data Pipeline Architecture
- **Consolidated artifacts**: `train_data[train_data['ISBN'] == book_isbn]` filtering
- **Individual models**: Per-entity modeling with shared infrastructure
- **Datetime handling**: Proper time series indexing throughout

### 5. Experiment Tracking
- **MLflow logging**: Individual model metrics and parameters
- **Pipeline tracking**: Overall success rate monitoring
- **Model registry**: Automated versioning for deployment

### 6. Vertex AI Production Readiness
- **Cloud deployment**: Native Vertex AI compatibility via ZenML
- **Artifact storage**: Models and data stored on Google Cloud
- **Environment configs**: `DEPLOYMENT_ENV` switching for cloud resources

## 🏢 Industry Standard Pattern

Your architecture follows the **"Train-Serve Split"** pattern used by:
- **Netflix**: Train recommendation models → Serve predictions via API
- **Uber**: Train demand forecasting → Real-time prediction service
- **Spotify**: Train music recommendation → On-demand playlist generation

## 🎯 Why This Architecture Is Optimal

### Flexibility
- Same model serves different forecast horizons
- Multiple inference endpoints can be deployed independently
- Real-time predictions with latest data

### Scalability
- Training and serving evolve independently
- Cost efficiency: train once, predict many times
- Vertex AI managed scaling for compute resources

### Maintainability
- Clean separation enables focused development
- Independent versioning of training and inference
- Rollback capabilities through MLflow Model Registry

## 📁 Pipeline Components

```
pipelines/
└── zenml_pipeline.py                    # Main training pipeline

scripts/
└── arima_forecast_load_artefacts.py     # Inference service

outputs/
├── models/arima/                        # Trained models (stored on Vertex AI)
└── plots/interactive/                   # Forecast visualizations
```

## 🛠️ Usage

### Training Pipeline
```bash
cd pipelines
python zenml_pipeline.py
```

### Generate Forecasts
```bash
cd scripts
python arima_forecast_load_artefacts.py
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Key Parameters
```python
DEFAULT_TEST_ISBNS = ['9780722532935', '9780241003008']
DEFAULT_SPLIT_SIZE = 32                  # Test set size (weeks)
DEFAULT_MAX_SEASONAL_BOOKS = 15          # Maximum books for modeling
```

### Vertex AI Deployment
```python
# Environment configuration for cloud deployment
deployment_env = os.getenv('DEPLOYMENT_ENV', 'development')
# Artifacts automatically stored on Google Cloud Storage
# Models registered in MLflow Model Registry for serving
```

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

### Scalability
- Optimized for 2-15 books; larger volumes need parallel processing
- Sequential model training; parallel training not implemented
- Memory constraints with consolidated artifacts

### Model Scope
- SARIMA only; no ensemble methods implemented
- Fixed 52-week seasonality assumption
- Limited external feature integration

### Infrastructure
- Manual model rollback process
- Basic monitoring and alerting capabilities
- Local development dependencies

## 🔮 Future Improvements

### Enhanced Modeling
- Ensemble methods combining SARIMA with ML models
- Dynamic seasonality detection and adjustment
- External features (holidays, promotions, economic data)

### Cloud Integration
- Vertex AI Pipelines for managed training orchestration
- BigQuery integration for data sourcing
- Cloud Functions for serverless inference endpoints

### Operational Excellence
- Automated model retraining triggers
- Advanced monitoring and alerting systems
- A/B testing framework for model comparison
