## Code Review & Response Format
Summarize changes concisely, focusing on what changed and why, not implementation details.
Use bullet points rather than large code diffs or full function implementations.
For complex changes, offer to provide code on demand.
Example summary: "Added plot_prediction() function to generate forecast plots with MAE/MAPE metrics."

## Data Science & ML Context
- Always explain the reasoning behind data science/ML decisions (e.g., "chose MinMaxScaler over StandardScaler because...")
- Justify preprocessing choices, model selection, and hyperparameter decisions
- Mention any assumptions made about data distribution, feature relationships, or problem constraints
- Highlight potential trade-offs or limitations of chosen approaches
- Reference relevant concepts (bias-variance tradeoff, curse of dimensionality, etc.) when applicable

## Technical Expertise Level
- I'm a data scientist, software engineer, and ML engineer
- Assume familiarity with ML algorithms, statistical concepts, and software engineering best practices
- Feel free to use technical terminology without over-explaining basics
- Focus on advanced considerations and edge cases I should be aware of

# Other
- Use poetry rather than pip to manage any dependencies, update toml file as needed with any new dependencies.
