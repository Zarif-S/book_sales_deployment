## Next Steps for Development and MLOps

As you build out your project, here‚Äôs the recommended order and focus areas:

### 1. Data Loading
- Write code to load your datasets (e.g., CSV files, databases, APIs) inside `classification_pipeline/steps/data_loader.py` and `regression_pipeline/steps/data_loader.py` (create if needed).
- Ensure the data is cleanly ingested and ready for processing.

### 2. Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Implement data cleaning, transformation, and feature creation inside new or existing step files (e.g., `preprocessing.py`, or add functions in `pipeline.py`).
- Prepare your data to be suitable for model training.

### 3. Model Training
- Code the logic for training your models using scikit-learn, XGBoost, or other libraries inside `trainer.py`.
- Ensure models are saved, versioned, and ready for evaluation.

### 4. Evaluation
- Add evaluation metrics and validation logic inside `evaluator.py`.
- Compare model performance and generate reports or visualizations.

### 5. Pipeline Orchestration
- Use ZenML to chain these steps (`data_loader`, `preprocessing`, `trainer`, `evaluator`) into reproducible, runnable pipelines.
- This allows you to automate, version, and track runs seamlessly.

## When Does MLOps Kick In?

Once your pipelines are working end-to-end, MLOps comes into play to:

- Automate pipeline runs and retraining workflows  
- Version your data, models, and code for reproducibility  
- Deploy models as scalable services or batch jobs  
- Monitor model health and performance over time  
- Manage infrastructure and scale resources effectively  
- Facilitate collaboration and governance through logging and audit trails  

ZenML provides tools to manage all these steps smoothly, enabling you to transition from development to production with confidence.

# What‚Äôs not covered yet but can be future enhancements:
- Building a REST API with FastAPI or Flask Not yet included.
This is ideal if:
- You want to expose your trained models for real-time inference.
- You want to integrate the model with front-end apps or external systems.

# Streaming platforms like Kafka
- Not yet included. Use Kafka if:
- You‚Äôre working with real-time data streams (e.g. log data, IoT sensors, clickstreams).
- You need to process or retrain models based on continuous input.

# Automated scheduling with Airflow or Prefect
- Partially covered ‚Äî ZenML includes a basic orchestrator, but:
- Airflow/Prefect bring more control over scheduling, retries, monitoring, and multi-step pipelines across systems.
- Useful if your project needs daily retraining, ETL pipelines, or cross-departmental data flows.

# Optional Enhancements :
- If you‚Äôre focusing on model development, stay as is. When you‚Äôre:
- Ready to serve models ‚Üí Add FastAPI/Flask, for serving trained models for real-time inference.
- Working with real-time data ‚Üí Explore Kafka allows streaming data ingestion or real-time processing.
- Need enterprise-grade automation to schedule and orchestrate data pipelines and retraining workflows. ‚Üí Add Airflow or Prefect.

# Dashboards & Monitoring (To Be Decided)
- You may wish to expose model outputs, evaluation metrics, or predictions using:

Simple Option: Show Static Results
If your use case doesn‚Äôt need interactivity:
Export plots, tables, or results as images or HTML
Embed directly into Squarespace using Image or Code Blocks

Pro Tip
If you want a clean, professional integration:
Use Streamlit to create a front-end for your model
Host it (on Render, GCP, etc.)
Embed it in your Squarespace site using an iframe:

1. Interactive ML Model
‚ÄúI want visitors to input something and get real-time predictions.‚Äù
Examples:
A user enters their financial data to predict loan approval.
Uploads a photo or CSV and receives analysis.
Enters text and gets sentiment or topic classification.
Best Setup:
Build a FastAPI or Flask API to serve your model.
Optionally wrap it in a Streamlit front-end for ease.
Host on Vertex AI (for scalability) or Render (for ease).
Embed into Squarespace using an <iframe>.

2. Dashboard/Insights Reporting
‚ÄúI want to show clients model results, performance metrics, or visualised insights.‚Äù
Examples:
A dashboard showing churn probabilities or forecasted sales.
Visual summary of model accuracy, confusion matrix, feature importances.
Best Setup:
Use Looker Studio (formerly Google Data Studio), Tableau Public, or Streamlit dashboards.
Embed via <iframe> or use downloadable reports.

5. Experiment / Portfolio Showcase
‚ÄúI want to show what I‚Äôve built to recruiters, clients, or collaborators.‚Äù
Examples:
Model showcase with a short description, outputs, and demo.
Include GitHub links, code walkthroughs, and results.
Best Setup:
Combine:
GitHub repo
Simple Streamlit demo (e.g., live model or dashboard)
Squarespace page with embedded live demo, write-up, and repo links

Main Goal:
Showcase your ML pipelines and results publicly ‚Äî ideally with:
A live demo (e.g. model predictions or visualisations),
A walkthrough of your approach (code, logic, pipeline),
And embedded visuals/dashboards on your Squarespace site.

Next Steps by Use Case
üß™ 5. Portfolio/Showcase (üîù Priority)
‚úÖ You have:
A working ZenML pipeline structure for classification & regression.
Clean project layout with Poetry and pyproject.toml.
üß© Add next:
Run your pipeline: flesh out your data loader, trainer, evaluator.
Save artifacts (e.g., plots, metrics, model.pkl) after evaluation.
Use Streamlit to create a simple demo:
Load model.
Accept user input (text, sliders, CSV upload).
Show prediction + confidence, or regression output.
Deploy Streamlit app:
Use Streamlit Community Cloud (Free).
Or use Render, Vercel, or [GCP App Engine].
Link or embed demo on your Squarespace portfolio:
Use an <iframe> block or a hyperlink.
üß† 1. Interactive ML (Secondary Priority)
Use case: Let users interact with your trained model.
How to do it:
If you're happy with Streamlit: it already serves as an interactive layer.
For more control: deploy the model via a FastAPI or Flask backend (optional for now).
Bonus: ZenML supports model deployment to Vertex AI, Seldon, etc.

2. Dashboards/Insights
Goal: Visualise key metrics from your model runs.
Options:
Use Streamlit to display metrics, confusion matrices, feature importances.
Save metrics to CSV and load them into:
Looker Studio (free with GCP),
Tableau Public,
Or even embed a Google Sheet chart into Squarespace.
Bonus: Track experiments using MLflow, already installed.
