How to Make Your Project Easy to Set Up

ðŸ§° 1. A Setup Script (setup.sh)

A Bash script that automates:
Installing Poetry
Setting the correct Python version
Creating the virtual environment
Installing dependencies

ðŸ“„ 2. A README.md with instructions
Clear setup and usage instructions â€” especially for non-technical users.

ðŸ“¦ 3. pyproject.toml + poetry.lock

Keep these committed â€” they define exact dependencies and allow others to reproduce your environment exactly.

ðŸ§ª 4. Optional: Add a Makefile (if you're into that)
Useful for defining tasks like make train, make install, etc.
